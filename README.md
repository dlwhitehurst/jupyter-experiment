# Jupyter Experiment

This experiment is quite complicated but underlying the end goal is a wonderful open-source thing
called the Jupyter Notebook. This README is where your journey begins. The file REAMDE.ipynb needs
a Jupyter Notebook environment to experience the full benefits of its contents.

See README.ipynb to set up your environment, create new notebooks, and run code cell contents 
interactively.
