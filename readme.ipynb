    "This Jupyter notebook is a Bash notebook. Jupyter notebooks run what's called a kernel to provide command processing. Notice in the upper right corner of this environment the Bash indicator with a little empty circle. This tells us that the kernel is Bash and it's currently not processing any commands. I first had to upgrade Python on this Macbook using Homebrew because pip was not configured correctly. Jupyter begins with a Python 3 environment, installed by Conda, along with the iPython and Notebook modules. \n",
